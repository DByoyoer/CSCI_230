      \item[C-12.1]  A native Australian named Anatjari wishes to cross a desert carrying only
            a single water bottle. He has a map that marks all the watering holes along
            the way. Assuming he can walk k miles on one bottle of water, design an
            efficient algorithm for determining where Anatjari should refill his bottle
            in order to make as few stops as possible. Argue why your algorithm is
            correct. \\
            \answer \\
            Use a greedy algorithm that chooses the watering hole that is the maximal distance
            still less than k miles. Do so until he reaches the end.

      \item[C-12.3] Give an example set of denominations of coins so that a greedy change-
            making algorithm will not use the minimum number of coins. \\
            \answer \\
            {25, 10, 1} to make 55 would use{25, 25, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} but the optimal solution is {25, 10, 10, 10}.
