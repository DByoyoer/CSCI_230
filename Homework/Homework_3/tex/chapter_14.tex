      \item[14.6]Consider an initially empty memory cache consisting of four pages. How
            many page misses does the LRU algorithm incur on the following page
            request sequence: (2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3)?\\
            \answer \\
            5 page misses.
      \item[14.7] Consider an initially empty memory cache consisting of four pages. How
            many page misses does the FIFO algorithm incur on the following page
            request sequence: (2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 5, 4, 1, 2, 3) \\
            \answer \\
            3 page misses.
